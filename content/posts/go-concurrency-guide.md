# Go Concurrency: Mastering Goroutines and Channels

Concurrency is one of Go's most powerful features, making it incredibly efficient for handling multiple tasks simultaneously. Unlike traditional threading models, Go's approach with goroutines and channels provides a safer and more intuitive way to write concurrent programs.

![Go Concurrency Patterns](./images/go-concurrency-patterns.png)

## Understanding Goroutines

Goroutines are lightweight threads managed by the Go runtime. They're much cheaper than OS threads and can be created in the thousands without significant overhead.

### Creating Goroutines

```go
func main() {
    // Regular function call
    sayHello("World")

    // Goroutine - runs concurrently
    go sayHello("Goroutine")

    // Wait for goroutine to complete
    time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
}

func sayHello(name string) {
    fmt.Printf("Hello, %s!\n", name)
}
```

**Key Benefits:**

- Extremely lightweight (2KB initial stack size)
- Managed by Go runtime scheduler
- No need for manual thread management
- Efficient context switching

## Channels: The Go Way of Communication

Channels provide a way for goroutines to communicate with each other safely. They follow the principle: _"Don't communicate by sharing memory; share memory by communicating."_

### Basic Channel Operations

```go
func main() {
    // Create a channel
    messages := make(chan string)

    // Send data to channel (in goroutine)
    go func() {
        messages <- "Hello from goroutine!"
    }()

    // Receive data from channel
    msg := <-messages
    fmt.Println(msg)
}
```

### Buffered vs Unbuffered Channels

```go
// Unbuffered channel (synchronous)
ch1 := make(chan int)

// Buffered channel (asynchronous)
ch2 := make(chan int, 3)

// Buffered channels don't block until buffer is full
ch2 <- 1
ch2 <- 2
ch2 <- 3
// ch2 <- 4 // This would block!
```

## Advanced Concurrency Patterns

### 1. Worker Pool Pattern

Perfect for distributing work across multiple goroutines:

```go
func workerPool(jobs <-chan int, results chan<- int) {
    for job := range jobs {
        // Simulate work
        time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
        results <- job * 2
    }
}

func main() {
    jobs := make(chan int, 100)
    results := make(chan int, 100)

    // Start 3 workers
    for w := 1; w <= 3; w++ {
        go workerPool(jobs, results)
    }

    // Send jobs
    for j := 1; j <= 9; j++ {
        jobs <- j
    }
    close(jobs)

    // Collect results
    for r := 1; r <= 9; r++ {
        <-results
    }
}
```

### 2. Fan-Out, Fan-In Pattern

Distribute work to multiple goroutines and collect results:

```go
func fanOut(input <-chan int) (<-chan int, <-chan int) {
    out1 := make(chan int)
    out2 := make(chan int)

    go func() {
        defer close(out1)
        defer close(out2)

        for val := range input {
            out1 <- val
            out2 <- val
        }
    }()

    return out1, out2
}

func fanIn(input1, input2 <-chan int) <-chan int {
    output := make(chan int)

    go func() {
        defer close(output)
        for {
            select {
            case val, ok := <-input1:
                if !ok {
                    input1 = nil
                } else {
                    output <- val
                }
            case val, ok := <-input2:
                if !ok {
                    input2 = nil
                } else {
                    output <- val
                }
            }
            if input1 == nil && input2 == nil {
                break
            }
        }
    }()

    return output
}
```

## Channel Patterns and Best Practices

### Select Statement for Non-Blocking Operations

```go
func main() {
    ch1 := make(chan string)
    ch2 := make(chan string)

    go func() {
        time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
        ch1 <- "Channel 1"
    }()

    go func() {
        time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
        ch2 <- "Channel 2"
    }()

    for i := 0; i < 2; i++ {
        select {
        case msg1 := <-ch1:
            fmt.Println("Received:", msg1)
        case msg2 := <-ch2:
            fmt.Println("Received:", msg2)
        case <-time.After(3 * time.Second):
            fmt.Println("Timeout!")
            return
        }
    }
}
```

### Context for Cancellation

```go
func worker(ctx context.Context, id int, jobs <-chan int) {
    for {
        select {
        case job := <-jobs:
            fmt.Printf("Worker %d processing job %d\n", id, job)
            time.Sleep(500 * time.Millisecond)
        case <-ctx.Done():
            fmt.Printf("Worker %d cancelled\n", id)
            return
        }
    }
}

func main() {
    ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 2*time.Second)
    defer cancel()

    jobs := make(chan int, 10)

    // Start workers
    for i := 1; i <= 3; i++ {
        go worker(ctx, i, jobs)
    }

    // Send jobs
    for j := 1; j <= 10; j++ {
        jobs <- j
    }

    // Wait for context cancellation
    <-ctx.Done()
    fmt.Println("All workers cancelled")
}
```

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

| Problem         | Solution                       | Example                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Goroutine leaks | Always provide exit conditions | Use `context.Context`   |
| Race conditions | Use channels or `sync` package | Mutex for shared state  |
| Deadlocks       | Avoid circular dependencies    | Careful channel closing |
| Memory leaks    | Close channels when done       | `defer close(ch)`       |

### Race Condition Example and Fix

**❌ Race Condition:**

```go
var counter int
for i := 0; i < 1000; i++ {
    go func() {
        counter++ // Race condition!
    }()
}
```

**✅ Fixed with Mutex:**

```go
var (
    counter int
    mu      sync.Mutex
)

for i := 0; i < 1000; i++ {
    go func() {
        mu.Lock()
        counter++
        mu.Unlock()
    }()
}
```

**✅ Better: Use Channel:**

```go
counter := make(chan int, 1)
counter <- 0

for i := 0; i < 1000; i++ {
    go func() {
        val := <-counter
        counter <- val + 1
    }()
}
```

## Performance Tips

> **Pro Tip:** Use buffered channels to reduce goroutine blocking and improve throughput in producer-consumer scenarios.

### Benchmarking Concurrent Code

```go
func BenchmarkWorkerPool(b *testing.B) {
    for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
        jobs := make(chan int, 100)
        results := make(chan int, 100)

        // Start workers
        for w := 1; w <= 3; w++ {
            go workerPool(jobs, results)
        }

        // Send jobs and collect results
        // ... benchmark code
    }
}
```

## Real-World Example: HTTP Server with Concurrency

```go
func handleRequest(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    // Each request runs in its own goroutine automatically
    data := processRequest(r)

    // Use goroutines for parallel processing
    ch := make(chan string, 3)

    go func() { ch <- fetchUserData(data.UserID) }()
    go func() { ch <- fetchProductData(data.ProductID) }()
    go func() { ch <- fetchAnalytics(data.SessionID) }()

    // Collect results
    for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
        result := <-ch
        fmt.Fprintf(w, "Result: %s\n", result)
    }
}

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/", handleRequest)
    log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil))
}
```

## Conclusion

Go's concurrency model with goroutines and channels provides a powerful yet simple way to write concurrent programs. Key takeaways:

- **Use goroutines** for lightweight concurrency
- **Communicate through channels** instead of shared memory
- **Apply proven patterns** like worker pools and fan-out/fan-in
- **Handle cancellation** properly with context
- **Avoid common pitfalls** like race conditions and goroutine leaks

Master these concepts, and you'll be able to build highly concurrent, efficient Go applications that can handle thousands of operations simultaneously! 🚀
